			<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
			<p>
				This Agreement was last revised on April 30, 2012.
			</p>
			<p>
				Welcome to <a href="home">www.coffeemobile.com</a>, a website and online service owned and operated by Coffee Software Design, Inc. (“Coffee Enterprise” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our service. By accessing or using the Coffee Enterprise services, website, applications and software provided through or in connection with the service, including through a mobile device (“Service”), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. All users of the Service (whether of the free service or a paid service) must agree to these terms.
			</p>

			<p>
				We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time and without notice. If we do this, we will post the amended Agreement on this page and indicate at the top of the page the date the Agreement was last revised. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).
			</p>
			<h3>Use of Our Service</h3>

			<p>
				Coffee Enterprise provides a place for people to communicate with others in their work or community networks (each, a “Network”) in real time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee Enterprise grants you permission to use the Service as set forth in this Agreement, provided that: (i) you will not copy, distribute, or disclose any part of the Service in any medium; (ii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Service other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Service for its intended purpose; and (iii) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will need to register with Coffee Enterprise and create a “Member” account. Your account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may never use another Member’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Coffee Enterprise immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Coffee Enterprise will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you shall be liable for the losses of Coffee Enterprise or others due to such unauthorized use.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may use your Account Settings to control your Member Profile. By providing Coffee Enterprise your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may use your Notifications Settings to opt out of many Service-related communications. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by changing the preferences in your Notifications Settings. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. Certain Corporate Networks have negotiated further modifications to the emails we may send you.
			</p>
			<p>
				You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,”  “offline readers,” etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Coffee Enterprise servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to use any portion of the Service as a destination linked from any unsolicited bulk messages or unsolicited commercial messages.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee Enterprise may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or otherwise refuse to permit your access to the Service without notice and liability, if, in Coffee Enterprise’s sole determination, you violate any of the Agreement, including the following prohibited actions: (i) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (ii) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (iii) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (iv) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (v) interfering with the proper working of the Service; or, (vi) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including, but not limited to, registering for the Service with a non-Network email address. Upon termination for any reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee Enterprise reserves the right to offer alternative and/or additional Services to certain administrative users, including administrators of Corporate Networks, that may not be offered to general Users. You acknowledge that Coffee Enterprise may charge a fee for the use of any Services, provided that Coffee Enterprise notifies you of any such fee before you incur it. Subject to the foregoing, you agree to pay any fees incurred by you.  In the event that you have elected to receive additional services for a fee, and you fail to pay such fee within thirty (30) days, then in addition to all other remedies available to Coffee Enterprise, Coffee Enterprise may immediately cease providing all such additional services.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you learn that a User is not authorized to be a Member of a Network or is otherwise violating this Agreement, we encourage you to visit such User’s Member profile page and follow the “click here”  link under the Admin section to notify us. You agree you will not accuse any User of being unauthorized or of violating this Agreement unless you have actual knowledge.
			</p>
			<h3>User Content</h3>

			<p>
				Some areas of the Service may allow Users to post feedback, comments, questions, data, and other information (“User Content”). You are solely responsible for your User Content that you upload, publish, display, link to or otherwise make available (hereinafter, “post”) on the Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. Coffee Enterprise will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such User Content except as provided herein or in our Privacy Policy or as may be required by law. Absent a Network Administrator (as defined below), all such User Content is owned by the User who posted it to the Service, although each User acknowledges and consents that upon the introduction of a Network Administrator into that User’s network, all related User Content will automatically become the property of the company to which the Network belongs without any notice to Users of that Network. If a Network has a Network Administrator, all such User Content is the property of the company to which the Network belongs (including all User Content posted to a specific Group or Groups within a Network and all User Content created prior to the existence of the Network Administrator). In either case, Coffee Enterprise does not have, nor does it claim, any ownership rights in any User Content. In addition, you should note that if you are no longer an eligible member of a network (e.g., you cease to be employed by the relevant company), your access to all User Content you uploaded may be terminated, regardless of whether the network has a Network Administrator. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the company which administers that Network.
			</p>
			<p>
				By utilizing the Service, you agree to have the domain portion of your email address (“@yourcorp.com”) and/or the company, school, or organization name represented by such domain portion of your email address, listed on the Coffee Enterprise website in a company directory listing (“Directory”). Customers (as defined below) who do not want to be included in such published Directory may send a written request to <a href="mailto:help@coffeemobile.com">help@coffeemobile.com</a> to remove their company, or organization name from the Directory. Certain Corporate Networks have negotiated further modifications to what we will put into the Directory.
			</p>
			<p>
				You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (iv) contains any information or content that is unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, or otherwise objectionable; (v) contains any information or content that is illegal; (vi) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (vii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below), rights of publicity and privacy. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coffee Enterprise takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other Users or third parties post or send over the Service. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or otherwise make available or access through your use of the Service, is solely your responsibility. Coffee Enterprise is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User Content. You understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree that Coffee Enterprise shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of such User Content.
			</p>
			<p>
				You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Coffee Enterprise Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.
			</p>
			<h3>Network Administration</h3>

			<h4>General</h4>

			<p>
				Each Network may have one or more individuals who are responsible for overseeing the use of and monitoring the content posted to, such Network (the “Network Administrator”). Networks may exist on the Service absent a Network Administrator; in such case Users are responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this Agreement. Premium Groups within a Network may also have a group administrator with certain authority that is less than that of a Network Administrator.
			</p>
			<p>
				From time to time, Users may be asked to confirm their account on the Network via an email message containing a hyperlink to the User’s  Network email address. If such account is not reconfirmed, the account is removed. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the company which administers that Network.
			</p>
			<p>
				Users should follow their particular company’s policies, guidelines, and procedures concerning the Content they post to the Service. Users may delete their own User Content from the Network, so long as they are a Member of that Network. Network Administrators may delete the User Content of one or more Users in their Network.
			</p>
			<h4>Groups</h4>

			<p>
				Individual Users may form a group to segment the audience for certain User Content (“Group”). Each Group may have one or more administrators  (the “Group Administrator”). A Group may be designated as open to any User in a Network (a “Public Group”) or a Group may be limited to  certain Users in a Network with membership subject to the approval of  the Group Administrator (a “Private Group”). A Group Administrator may add or remove Users to that particular Group. Though Users may establish  a Private Group, User Content posted within a Private Group on a  Network is owned by that Network.
			</p>
			<h3>Mobile Use</h3>

			<h4>General</h4>
			<p>
				Users may elect to receive regular short message service (“SMS”) alerts of new Coffee Enterprise content through mobile telephone device carriers that may be supported via Coffee Enterprise SMS. You may receive help for SMS content delivery by contacting Coffee Enterprise customer support at <a href="mailto:help@coffeemobile.com">help@coffeemobile.com</a>. There is no fee charged by Coffee Enterprise for Users to receive text messages. Standard text messaging rates and other charges from a User’s carrier may apply.
			</p>
			<h3>License Grant</h3>
			<p>
				Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, personal license to use the Service. Coffee Enterprise reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Coffee Enterprise Content (as defined below). Unless Coffee Enterprise has agreed otherwise with respect to a Corporate Network, Coffee Enterprise may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.
			</p>
			<h3>Our Proprietary Rights</h3>
			<p>
				Except for your User Content, the Service and its materials, including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos and music (the “Coffee Enterprise Content”), and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of Coffee Enterprise and its licensors. Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any materials or content accessible on the Service. Use of the Coffee Enterprise Content or materials on the Service for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Coffee Enterprise under any fiduciary or other obligation, that we are free to disclose the Ideas on a non-confidential basis to anyone or otherwise use the Ideas without any additional compensation to you. You acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Coffee Enterprise does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Coffee Enterprise, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.
