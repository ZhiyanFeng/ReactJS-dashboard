### Rpush. The push notification service for Ruby.

* Supports:
  * **Apple Push Notification Service**
  * **Google Cloud Messaging)**
  * **Amazon Devide Messaging**
  * **Windows Push Notification Service**.
* Seamless Rails (3, 4) integration.
* Scalable - choose the number of persistent connections for each app.
* Designed for uptime - signal -HUP to add, update apps.
* Run as a daemon or inside an [existing processs](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Embedding-API).
* Use in a scheduler for low-workload deployments ([Push API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Push-API)).
* Hooks for fine-grained instrumentation and error handling ([Reflection API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Reflection-API)).
* Works with MRI, JRuby, Rubinius 1.9, 2.0, 2.1.


### Getting Started

Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rpush'
```

Generate the migrations, rpush.yml and migrate:

```
rails g rpush
rake db:migrate
```

### Create an App & Notification

#### Apple Push Notification Service

If this is your first time using the APNs, you will need to generate SSL certificates. See [Generating Certificates](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Generating-Certificates) for instructions.

```ruby
app = Rpush::Apns::App.new
app.name = "ios_app"
app.certificate = File.read("/path/to/sandbox.pem")
app.environment = "sandbox" # APNs environment.
app.password = "certificate password"
app.connections = 1
app.save!
```

```ruby
n = Rpush::Apns::Notification.new
n.app = Rpush::Apns::App.find_by_name("ios_app")
n.device_token = "..."
n.alert = "hi mom!"
n.attributes_for_device = {:foo => :bar}
n.save!
```

You should also implement the [ssl_certificate_will_expire](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Reflection-API) reflection to monitor when your certificate is due to expire.

#### Google Cloud Messaging

```ruby
app = Rpush::Gcm::App.new
app.name = "android_app"
app.auth_key = "..."
app.connections = 1
app.save!
```

```ruby
n = Rpush::Gcm::Notification.new
n.app = Rpush::Gcm::App.find_by_name("android_app")
n.registration_ids = ["..."]
n.data = {:message => "hi mom!"}
n.save!
```

GCM also requires you to respond to [Canonical IDs](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Canonical-IDs).

#### Amazon Device Messaging

```ruby
app = Rpush::Adm::App.new
app.name = "kindle_app"
app.client_id = "..."
app.client_secret = "..."
app.connections = 1
app.save!
```

```ruby
n = Rpush::Adm::Notification.new
n.app = Rpush::Adm::App.find_by_name("kindle_app")
n.registration_ids = ["..."]
n.data = {:message => "hi mom!"}
n.collapse_key = "Optional consolidationKey"
n.save!
```

For more documentation on [ADM](https://developer.amazon.com/sdk/adm.html).

#### Windows Phone Notification Service

```ruby
app = Rpush::Wpns::App.new
app.name = "windows_phone_app"
app.connections = 1
app.save!
```

```ruby
n = Rpush::Wpns::Notification.new
n.app = Rpush::Wpns::App.find_by_name("windows_phone_app")
n.uri = "http://..."
n.alert = "..."
n.save!
```

### Starting Rpush

As a daemon:

    cd /path/to/rails/app
    rpush <Rails environment> [options]

Inside an existing process (see [Embedding API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Embedding-API)):

```ruby
Rpush.embed
```

*Please note that only ever a single instance of Rpush should be running.*

In a scheduler (see [Push API](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Push-API)):

```ruby
Rpush.push
Rpush.apns_feedback
```

See [Configuration](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Configuration) for a list of options, or run `rpush --help`.

### Updating Rpush

After updating you should run `rails g rpush` to check for any new migrations.

### Contributing

Fork as usual and go crazy!

When running specs, please note that the ActiveRecord adapter can be changed by setting the `ADAPTER` environment variable. For example: `ADAPTER=postgresql rake`.

Available adapters for testing are `mysql`, `mysql2` and `postgresql`.

Note that the database username is changed at runtime to be the currently logged in user's name. So if you're testing
with mysql and you're using a user named 'bob', you will need to grant a mysql user 'bob' access to the 'rpush_test'
mysql database.
